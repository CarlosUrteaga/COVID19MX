    "At the end of 2019, the world saw the born of the Sars-cov-2 virus which genereate a disease called COVID19 (COrona VIrus disease). The high risk that we face with this virus is that the sympthons are related to a typical flu but generate a high damage un the lungs decreasing the oxygen level. The disminution of oxygen generate a high demand of intensive beds.\n",

    "According to the WHO the incubation period for COVID-19, is on average 5-6 days, but can be extended to 14 days. However there some evidence that shows that exist different types of transmition, such as symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and a symptomatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical transmition is the symptomatic, this ocurrs when a person shown COVID symptomatic and can spread the virus conciently or inconciently respiratory droplest over thier enviroment. However, some cases has shown that a person can transmit COVID-19 without symptoms, (3 or 2 days) before present the typical symptoms. Finally there are some concern about the asyptomatic transmission according to the WHO: Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms. There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no documente asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries.
